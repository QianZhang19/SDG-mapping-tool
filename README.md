## Roadmap

- Data washing for the input documents (retain the main words in each document)
  
- Collection of the corpus for the words include the keywords of SDGs and each main word in the documents
  
- Creation of the matrix for the corpus and the input documents (rows of the matrix are documents and each SDG; columns of the matrix is words of them)
  
- Calculation of the mean value for each row (get the centre of the input document)
  
- Distance measurement between each SDG and each document
  
- Selection of the closer distance as mapping results
-
